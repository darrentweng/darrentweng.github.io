My name is Darren T. Weng, a student at Penn. I plan to double major in [Computer Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/undergraduate/) from Engineering and [Economics](https://economics.sas.upenn.edu/undergraduate/majors-and-minors/economics-major) from College, with [Statistics minor from Wharton](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/programs/undergraduate/statistics-minor/)

I’m a dedicated Penn Engineering student, double majoring in [Computer Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/undergraduate/) and [Economics](https://economics.sas.upenn.edu/undergraduate/majors-and-minors/economics-major) from College, minoring in [Statistics and Data Science](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/programs/undergraduate/statistics-minor/) from Wharton. My goal is to blends technology, statistics and economics, from machine learning to econometrics, to tackle real-world challenges. I’m passionate about using coding and data analysis to uncover insights and drive innovation in AI and finance. Through collaborative projects and internships, I hope to create meaningful solutions that make a difference. Curious and committed, I’m excited to learn, grow, and contribute to a future where technology and economics shape a better world.
