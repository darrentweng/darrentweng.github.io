Plato Academy was a school of philosophy founded by the ancient Greek philosopher Plato in the 4th century BCE. Plato was a student of Socrates and a teacher of Aristotle, and his Academy was the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. The Academy was known for its rigorous and comprehensive curriculum, which included subjects such as mathematics, natural science, politics, and ethics.

Plato's Academy was influential in the development of Western thought and played a significant role in the transmission of knowledge from ancient Greece to later civilizations. Plato's dialogues, which were written in the form of conversations that took place at the Academy, are still widely read and studied today for their insights into philosophical questions about truth, justice, and the nature of reality.
