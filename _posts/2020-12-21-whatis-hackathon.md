A hackathon is an event, usually hosted by a school, tech company, or organization, where programmers and hackers get together for a short period of time to collaborate on a project. The participants work rapidly and often work without sleep to achieve their task, as the events generally last for only 24 hours or take place over a weekend.

What is a Hackathon? A hackathon is “about learning, about community, about fun.”

## Competitive Coding v.s. Hackathon

While both are mostly related to coding, Competitive Coding (e.g., USACO) is about low-level problem solving, math & algorithms,  a Hackathon is about high-level problem solving, creativity and persuasion.
