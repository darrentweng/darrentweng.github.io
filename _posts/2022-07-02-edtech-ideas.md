Below are some Education Tech startup ideas I have in mind. All of them are worth investing some time to further investigate.

**Personalized learning**: Many students learn at different paces and have different learning styles, and technology can be used to create customized learning experiences that cater to each student's individual needs.

**Virtual reality and augmented reality for education**: These technologies have the potential to make learning more immersive and engaging, and could be used for things like virtual field trips or simulations.

**Adaptive tutoring systems**: These systems use artificial intelligence to monitor a student's progress and provide personalized feedback and guidance.

**Online course platforms**: With the rise of remote learning, there has been an increase in demand for platforms that allow educators to create and deliver online courses.

**Web3 Badges**: Gamification gives students lots of incentives to learn, but today's systems are so fragmented, we need a way to issue and display certificates without a centralized location. Blockchain is the best technology to achieve this.
