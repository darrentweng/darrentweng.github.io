## Definition
To me, being a “man” is taking the responsibility to support one’s loved ones. Instead of being contrasted with women, being a man is more contrasted with being a young boy. Defining men through the lens of age is a pragmatic and important definition that is vital to the development of young men in my family.

Firstly, to be considered more of a man, one could take up more household responsibilities and contribute more to the house. At first, it is normal for parents to organize the kids’ workspaces, rooms, and toys. Then, as the kids grow older and more able, they are expected to clean their own messes when asked to by their parents. Next, they start to independently organize their own spaces and even willingly start to adopt activities that benefit the whole household. Even if the tasks are less desirable such as cleaning bathrooms or washing dishes, men should feel a duty to contribute to the household and give back to their families.

Secondly, being able to financially contribute to a family is important in becoming a man. Though material possessions are not the most important thing in life, I emphasize the importance of financial independence and security in being fulfilled as a person and in supporting a family in the future. It is better to make stable, logical financial decisions with a lower income than to make irrational, wasteful decisions to waste money with a greater income. In order to support loved ones, it is often important for mature men to prioritize their future over immediate gratification.
So, overall, being a man means being responsible enough to make sacrifices and put in the effort to provide for the well-being of those who they care about most.  

## Classification
Despite recent efforts toward gender equality, there are still modern societal perceptions of masculinity and femininity. Masculinity is often associated with strength, aggression, and competitiveness, while femininity is often associated with tenderness, emotionality, and submissiveness. These generalized, yet often inaccurate aspects of societal perceptions can explain why certain behaviors or traits are classified as either masculine or feminine.
First of all, nurturing children is classified by these societal guidelines as a feminine trait as women are seen as better caretakers because of their supposed inherent emotionality, helping them better connect with children. Meanwhile, society sees mens’ stereotypical aggression as incompatible with taking a more active role in caring for children. So, because of the patience and supportiveness involved in nurturing children, taking care of children is seen as feminine behavior.

In contrast, being physically strong and maintaining a muscular physique is seen as a masculine trait. Because strength is associated with masculinity, working out to build up strength and muscle is much more typical of a man. Meanwhile, many women are expected to maintain a slender physique as it is not built on strength but indicates fertility and youth instead.

Finally, engaging in competitive sports is often classified as a masculine trait as men are traditionally seen as more competitive as well as stronger. In addition, many competitive sports involve higher amounts of aggression, especially contact sports. So, society classifies these sports as masculine because they align more with traditionally masculine characteristics.

Being an environmentalist involves a commitment to protecting the natural world and working towards a more sustainable future. There are a few clear aspects to being an environmentalist: understanding, protecting, and educating.
First, it is important to understand the various environmental issues facing the world today and the actions one could take to help resolve these issues. This includes being informed about the various ways in which human activity is impacting the natural world, such as climate change, pollution, habitat destruction, and resource depletion. Environmentalists should strive to stay up-to-date on these issues and be aware of the latest research and developments. It is also useful to be informed on what lifestyle choices can help protect the environment.
In addition, it is vital to take direct action in order to protect the environment. For example, one could engage in activities such as volunteering for conservation organizations, participating in beach cleanups, or advocating for policies that promote sustainability. Environmentalists could also simply change their lifestyles to live in a more environmentally conscious way and reduce their carbon footprints.
Lastly, environmentalists should help educate others on the environment. It is vital for them to share their knowledge and passion for the natural world with others as it inspires them to become environmentalists themselves, growing the number of environmentalists and helping the environment on a larger scale. Together, we can create a more sustainable future for us all.


## Narration
The year was 1945 in the town of Huwei in Japanese-occupied Taiwan. The town had been the location of the largest sugar factory in Taiwan, making it the center of sugar production and earning it its nickname, the “Sugar Capital”. The town’s importance in the Japanese colonial economy made its factories a target of scheduled Allied air raids. However, at the age of 6, all my grandfather knew was the planes and the devastation they left and all he felt was fear.

One second he was sitting in his home with his siblings and parents and the other, they were all scrambling to their feet as they heard the all too familiar wails of the sirens signaling yet another bombing on their town. As he rushed out of the door, he saw the American bombers in the skyline, headed for the sugar factories. He pumped his legs as much as possible to reach shelter. However, his legs, clumsy and little at the time, betrayed him as he fell behind the moving crowd. The rough terrain around him, made treacherous by stray explosives, did nothing to help his frantic run. He desperately willed himself to run faster and faster, fearing for his life. 

At last, he made it into the cold, dark concrete tunnel which had saved his life many times before. Moments after, he heard a deafening boom and felt small fragments slice his skin as the ground quaked beneath his light feet. The loud noises and danger continued for hours until he was left with small wounds and deafness in his left ear for a day.

While his physical wounds quickly recovered, it was clear that his psyche did not. For years after the war, despite him speaking a new language under a new Chinese name in a new country, his children and grandchildren could hear his screams in the middle of the night, as his subconscious recalled the days he tried his hardest to forget.

## Cause and Effect
Cleaning one’s room brings many observable benefits to their life. First, cleaning one’s room instills a sense of responsibility in someone. When someone cleans their room, they become accustomed to caring for themself and being responsible for their own messes. They will learn that it is their own duty to treat their room right and be mindful of their habits so that they do not have to spend more time cleaning their room in the future due to irresponsible actions. 

Cleaning a room also directly improves hygiene and sanitation, leading to greater health and vitality. For example, improved air quality resulting from cleaning dust in one’s room can help with one’s respiratory problems as it can help eliminate allergens. Another example is that a made and organized bed would make it easier for someone to fall asleep, increasing their sleep quality which will benefit their overall mental and physical health.

Lastly, cleaning a room can help develop organizational skills that can be used in many areas of life. Organizing items in a room trains individuals to be able to organize their school desks, backpacks, or offices. Organization is an important skill that helps one save great amounts of time and allows them to accomplish more with what they have. When one cleans a room and organizes the items inside that room, one will be better able to organize other spaces in the future.

In conclusion, cleaning one’s room has an assortment of benefits that could increase fulfillment in one’s life.

## Process Analysis
Cleaning your room is an essential habit to have in your life. However, many people find it difficult to get started in the first place. Still, with this guide, I will show you how to clean your room. 

First, carefully observe your room. Be sure to mentally note down every area that needs cleaning and make a list of what specifically needs to be done. It is easier to do a task once you break it up into smaller parts. Secondly, gather supplies you might need to start cleaning your room, including a trash bag, cleaning solution, rags, or a vacuum cleaner. Then, start with general organization. Move messy clothes off of your bed or chair and put them in your drawers. Put any papers in a neat and organized style. While organizing, if any objects are unnecessary and are simply just taking up space in your room, make sure to throw them out. After everything is in its right location, start making your room clean by removing dust and dirt. Start by vacuuming to get rid of bigger particles and other objects that can be sucked easily. A vacuum is also a good tool to use for places under beds or chairs that do not have that much vertical space. Lastly, use a rag along with water or a cleaning solution to get rid of any dirt and germs left behind. It is important to clean important areas such as mirrors and windows and disinfect areas that you contact regularly so that you do not get sick. 

With these simple, clear steps, you can be on your way to effective cleaning and organizing of your room.
## Description
The room has a classy, convenient design. A glass lazy susan sits in the middle of the dark wood table to facilitate sharing between family members. 
As soon as it arrives, the rich, savory aroma naturally wafts through the air. The glossy porcelain bowl is warm to the touch, wisps of smoke rising from the soup as if it was one of the infamous hot springs from its native country. The light dances on the long “QQ” noodles of medium thickness and the tender chunks of succulent dark brown beef. The bright green scallions and bok choy contrast with the rich, red broth. The broth is hot, both in temperature and in spice level, but still tame enough to quickly slurp up.
As I get ready to eat, I feel the warmth of the steam on my face. I feel the weight of the noodles, beef, and soup on my porcelain spoon. A mouthful of broth fills my mouth, lighting fire to my tongue and warming my body. Each taste bud gets waves of pure umami delight married with drops of fat from the beef. The bouncy, starchy noodles slip into my mouth to bounce within my teeth, making a satisfying slurping noise. Meanwhile, the juicy, soft beef melts in my mouth, leaving juices and vestigial chunks in my teeth. Lastly, the bok choy adds a much needed crunch, adding more texture and depth to the dish. The flavors and textures of the beef, vegetables, noodles, and soup mingle in my mouth to create the quintessential dish. 
## Compare And Contrast
With the emergence of artificial intelligence and increasingly intelligent models over the last few years, it is important to make distinctions and similarities between these neural networks and human brains.

First off, artificial neural networks and human brains have some similarities which make them act in similar ways. Both neural networks and human brains are complex systems that are capable of processing and interpreting information. They are both made up of many interconnected units called neurons that work together to perform tasks. This structure allows them to learn and adapt based on experience, recognize patterns to make predictions on, and process and store large amounts of information. In addition, both are able to adapt and change over time.

However, while neurons in the human brain are biological, natural structures in the brain along with the synapses that connect them, artificial neural networks are made up of computer algorithms that try to simulate the behavior of neurons. Human brains are also notably more complex and sophisticated when compared to their technical counterparts as a result of their billions of neurons and trillions of synapses, which can perform a greater variety of functions compared to the relatively simple neural networks that are limited by the algorithms and data that are programmed into them. This restriction on artificial neural networks also causes human brains to be more flexible and dynamic in their thinking and learning. Lastly, human brains are also generally more capable of creativity compared to neural networks.
