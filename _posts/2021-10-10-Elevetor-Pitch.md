An elevator pitch is a brief summary of an idea or application that explains its concepts in a short amount of time. 

While elevator pitches can be used for various things such as introducing yourself for a job interview, we are going to be focusing on their use in hackathons. They are extremely important to hackathons as you need to be able to explain your application concisely and effectively to judges.
