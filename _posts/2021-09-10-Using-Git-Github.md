### Git

It allows many versions of a software to run on different members’ machines and the branching and merging of those versions. 

When you run git on the command prompt there are [commands](https://git-scm.com/docs) that you can use for version control to push, clone, commit, and pull.

On Visual Studio Code, a popular code-editor that we will be using this year, there is integrated source control management and a git extension that allows you to easily do source control in the IDE.

### Github

Github is a Internet hosting service for version control using git. You can create public repositories with Github that your teammates can access. You can also use Github to “clone” repositories to a local directory and then make changes, pull, commit, and push it up to the original.

[Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) are simple websites hosted by Github that allow users to display information easily from a markdown file. 

[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) is a markdown language that can be used to create formatted text. Markdown is very simple with different syntax being used to notate how different texts should appear. For example, a heading would have a hashtag right before the text  (e.g., # Heading One)
