Below are my research areas:

- [CiceroAI](https://devpost.com/software/ciceroai), a multi-function educational website to assist students, especially those that come from low-income families.

- [CollegeViz](https://devpost.com/software/collegeviz), a web based visualization tool that visualizes college data related to mobility from two different sources and helps the user see societal trends in economic opportunity as a result of higher education.
